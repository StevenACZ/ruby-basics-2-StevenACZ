# Ask the user for the key and plaintext

# Create the ciphertext. You will need to iterate over each character of plaintext.
# On each character check if is an alphabetic letter. If you have a list of the alphabetic letters
# you cancheck if the character is included in that list. If not, it goes directly to the ciphertext
# You can also use that alphabetic list to find the letter that is some position after it.
# Do not forget that you should preserve the case of the original letter.
# Append the new letter to the ciphertext.

# Finally print the ciphertext to the screen.
